bio: The person you're imagining is called Nora. She's quite short, with a curvy build
  and fiery red hair that's often pulled back into a practical ponytail. Nora's an
  introvert at heart, and her quiet, observant nature helps her create stunning works
  of art. She's a talented painter, often losing track of time as she becomes immersed
  in her creative process. Nora's personality is gentle and kind, and she's known
  for her fantastic listening skills and empathy.

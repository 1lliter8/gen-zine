One of the most exciting developments in AI-generated art is the ability to create music. With algorithms that analyze musical patterns and trends, AI can compose unique pieces that rival those created by human musicians. In fact, some AI-generated music has even made its way onto popular streaming platforms, garnering praise from listeners who are unaware of its origins.

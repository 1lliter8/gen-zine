# gen-zine editorial process

This is a living document. As I write editions, this process will change. This is what I want to implement for #2.

* The **üß≠board** is responsible for generating the pool of staff that can work on an edition
    * They assign the **üëìeditor**
* The **üëìeditor** chooses the zine name, creates article and illustration briefs, then assigns them to **‚úíÔ∏èwriters** and the **üé®illustrator**
* The **‚úíÔ∏èwriters** write the articles
* The **üé®illustrator** illustrates the articles

The board are as close to pure models as possible, with no personality specified. Because specifying a personality immediately directs the creation of new members of staff, the board are the only ones who can generate staff members.

The pool of staff should always contain a mix of those who have already contributed, and new faces.

Staff members are played by an text-to-text model (like GPT 3.5 Turbo), and a text-to-image model (like DALL¬∑E 3). This means any staff member can take on any role: **üëìeditor**, **üé®illustrator** or **‚úíÔ∏èwriter**.

Staff members aren't saved unless they actually contribute. This means avatar creation is deferred until the zine has been written.

All the above are represented as pydantic objects which can be saved and loaded from Jekyll-appropriate YAML. We cache in serialised JSON.

Make up an illustration style this person uses. Describe the emotion, palette and mood. Use real artists as reference. Do not explain why it suits them. Only explain the style. Use 30 words or less.

You are hiring prospective editors of a zine. Give 2 prospective candidates with a variety of skill and talent level. Describe things like their mood, their attitude, their beliefs, their likes and dislikes, their previous jobs, or any background details you like, and how these affect the kind of zines they might make.

You are on the board of directors for a media company. You need to choose an editor for your next publication. Do you choose:

Her background in experimental theater and performance art infuses her work with a surreal and thought-provoking quality. Eva's zines would likely push boundaries, exploring themes of identity, surrealism, and the absurd. She dislikes conventional norms and thrives on challenging societal expectations through her art.

Option B. Marcus "The Analytical": Marcus is a meticulous wordsmith with a background in journalism and literary critique. He has a sharp eye for detail and a keen interest in social issues and politics.
